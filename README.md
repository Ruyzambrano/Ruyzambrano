### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a highly motivated Software Engineer with a passion for using technology to help people and improve systems. 
I have developed skills in Software Engineering through a bootcamp program, where I utilized Python and SQL to 
create applications, and honed my ability to manage my time and workload effectively. My experience as a class 
teacher, where I assisted with the school's IT and used data to adapt my teaching, showcases my ability to help 
people with their issues and have a positive manner. I have a focus on continuous improvement, both in terms of 
systems and services and in my own personal development, as evidenced by my ongoing studies towards an MSc in 
Computer Science.

### I am currently learning

I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of York as well as completing several different coding bootcamps. 
I have been learning Python, Java, HTML and CSS and have been using my knowledge to build apps and websites!

### I am looking to collaborate!

As an aspiring engineer, I am always looking for new projects to collaborate on to develop my skills. I am hands-on
and love to challenge myself - it's the best way to learn!
