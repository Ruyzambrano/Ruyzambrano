## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring Data Engineer with a huge interest in technology, AI and how tech can have a role in dance! As an ex-teacher, I am looking to develop my skills in programming languages and work within the tech industry.


## I am currently learning

I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of York as well as completing several different coding bootcamps. I have been learning Python, Java, HTML and CSS and have been using my knowledge to build apps and websites!


## I am looking to collaborate!

As an aspiring engineer, I am always looking for new projects to collaborate on to develop my skills. I am hands-on and love to challenge myself - it's the best way to learn!

## Take a look how I integrate tech into performance!

### [*This has been coming a long time, now*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-Hg4UPXeY0&ab_channel=RuyZambrano) 

This performance uses a manipulated video of the dancer to create a monstrous digital double. Based on the research about Victorian Gothic horror, the performance integrates themes of the unknown and uncanny through technological ambiguity such as dim lights, projection, sound and using the dancer's skin as a projection surface.

### [*We Found It With Each Other*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVFoqOnRDgM&ab_channel=RuyZambrano) 

As part of an undergraduate thesis, this performance uses tech to segment it into chunks. As the performance changes, tech is used to keep track of time, cue light and sound changes as well as add stunning visuals to highlight movement.
